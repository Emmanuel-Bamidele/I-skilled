# Candidate Assessment & Petition Management Application

This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed to streamline candidate assessment for immigration petitions (e.g., EB1A, EB2, EB2_NIW, EB3). The application handles user authentication, candidate data collection, automated scoring and analysis, file uploads (including resumes, financial proofs, exhibits, etc.), petition detail management, and even AI-powered content generation via Deepseek.
